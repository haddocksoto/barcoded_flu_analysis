    "## Tissue Homogenizations \n",
    "\n",
    "Tissues are homogenized to make a 10% weight by volume (w/v) suspension (or 5% or 20% w/v for smaller or larger organs, respectively) for virus titration and to extract viral RNA for detection of viral nucleic acids. Tissue samples should ideally only have one freeze/thaw cycle between harvest and processing. Ideally, our samples should be harvested, snap-frozen and stored at -80C until a later date, when they are thawed, homogenized, and titered in 1 day. Samples should be kept on wet ice or at 4C at all times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Protocol: ###\n",
    "1. Prelabel cryotubes for each sample.\n",
    "2. Prepare a sample sheet to record sample IDs and organ weight to calculate the amount of medium needed to prepare a 10% (w/v) suspension.\n",
    "3. Autoclave homogenizer tips in autoclavable bags if needed.\n",
    "4. Organize tissues on wet ice starting with the samples anticipated to have the lowest virus titer and ending with the samples anticipated to have the highest titer of virus.\n",
    "5. Weigh each sample and record the weight on the pre-made spreadsheet.\n",
    "6. Add 1% streptomycin antibiotic to the L-15 and filter-sterilzed the media before use.\n",
    "7. Add L-15 tissue grinding medium to each tube; a minimum of 1.5 ml is needed. A 10% (w/v) suspension is adequate for most organs. For example, if a tissue weights 0.54g, add 5.4ml L-15 medium for 10% (w/v) suspension.\n",
    "8. Set up the Omni homogenizer and prepare beakers containing 10% bleach solution to disinfect tips. Also, prepare a 50-ml conical with 10% bleach solution.\n",
    "9. Place absorbent pads in the work area.\n",
    "10. Homogenize each organ using the tissue homogenizer. The amount of time needed to homogenize organs varies with the size and consistency of the tissue and the speed of the motor. \n",
    "11. Before removing the used tip from the grinder, immerse it in a 50-ml conical tube containing 10% bleach to disinfect.\n",
    "12. Remove the grinder tip and place it in a beaker containing 10% bleach. Put a new tip on the homogenizer and continue until all tissues are homogenized.\n",
    "13. Centrifuge the homogenized samples to pellet cellular debris 10 min at ~524 x g , 4C.\n",
    "14. Organize the cryotubes in racks and aliquote as needed.\n",
